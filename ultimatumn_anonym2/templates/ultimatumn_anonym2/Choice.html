    The proposer's task is to split 100$ between themselves and the other player. You need to maxmize your own gain across all rounds. The responder can either
    accept or decline the offer you propose. If the offer is accepted you keep the remaining money (100$ minus the amount you choose to send), but if
    the responder decline the offer, you lose all money in the round.
