    <p>
        This is an ultimatum game.
        To play, you will be paired with another player on the server.
        You and the other player will either be assigned the role as <font><b>"proposer"</font></b> or as <font><b>"responder"</font></b>.
        The proposer's task is to split 100$ between themselves and the other player. The responder can either
        accept or decline the offer. If the offer is accepted the proposer keeps the remaining money, but if
        the responder declines the proposer lose all their money.
    </p>

        <p>
Example of the game: The proposer chooses to <b>send</b> $20 to the responder.
            If the responder <b>accepts</b>  the offer of $20 they keep $20, and the proposer keeps $80 (the remaining money).
            If the responder <b>declines</b> the offer you both gain $0 in that round.
    </p>

        In this game <b><font> you have been assigned the role as proposer</font></b>, and the <b><font> other player
        is the responder</font></b>. You need to maxmize your own gain across all rounds and end with as much money as possible.
